This is my attempt to use github from within emacs, using magit and forge.
->Seems to be working!

For this project, I will be attempting to work through the problems on ProjectEuler.net in order. I hope it will provide a fun way to practice mathematical thinking and learn some computer science concepts. Slowly working through these and also reading up on important algorithms should provide important practice in addition to my specific language and framework learning.
